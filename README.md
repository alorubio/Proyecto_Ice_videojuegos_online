# Marketing Strategy through Data Analysis

The Ice online store sells video games worldwide. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g., Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available through open sources.

## Objective
Identify patterns that determine whether a game is successful or not, in order to identify promising projects and plan advertising campaigns for 2017.

To achieve this objective, we will work with the database provided by the company and examine the information obtained from 2016 to develop appropriate strategies for 2017.
